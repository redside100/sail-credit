            - RATIONALE: The less SSC a user has, the less they lose on flake.
        - Number of incidents in the last N days where the user has flaked on a party.

            should lose more SSC. Checks last N days instead of parties to incentivize
            consistent behavior, and can't be erased by joining 20 parties in a day.
        - How long the party was established for before the user flaked.
            - RATIONALE: Discourages users from flaking on parties that have been
            established for a long time, when other people have invested more time into
            waiting.
        - The party's current size.

            flake.
